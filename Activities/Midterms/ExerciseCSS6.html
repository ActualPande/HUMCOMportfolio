                For fans of the horror genre, discovering games that delve deep into psychological terror and explore dark, unsettling themes is always a thrill. Indie studio 
                <a href="https://projectmoon.fandom.com/wiki/Project_Moon" target="_blank">Project Moon</a> is a developer that has mastered the art of creating nightmarish, 
                thought-provoking worlds that are far from conventional. Their games, <a href="https://lobotomycorp.fandom.com/wiki/Home" target="_blank">Lobotomy Corporation</a> and 
                <a href="https://library-of-ruina.fandom.com/wiki/Library_Of_Ruina_Wiki" target="_blank">Library of Ruina</a>, offer horror fans a unique blend of storytelling, gameplay, 
                and atmosphere. What sets Project Moon apart is its ability to combine dark narratives with innovative gameplay mechanics. In Lobotomy Corporation, players are tasked with 
                managing a corporation that contains dangerous entities known as "<a href="https://projectmoon.fandom.com/wiki/Abnormalities" target="_blank">Abnormalities</a>." While it 
                may sound like a typical management sim at first glance, the game is packed with horrific imagery, moral dilemmas, and existential questions that make players feel the 
                weight of every decision. The horror isn’t just in the gruesome visuals, but in the overwhelming sense of responsibility and the ethical compromises the player must face. 
                This type of emotional and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-mind-of-a-collector/202410/when-horror-is-a-hobby#:~:text=Horror%20stimulates%20the%20nervous%20system,as%20a%20%22fear%20vaccine.%22" target="_blank">psychological horror</a> 
                is a rare but powerful experience. In Library of Ruina, the terror is no longer just external but internal, as players enter a strange library where the battles they face 
                are rooted in the inner workings of human nature and despair. The game’s turn-based combat is coupled with a narrative that explores the darker side of humanity, including 
                suffering, loss, and the pursuit of meaning. The visceral nature of the combat, combined with the thematic elements of the story, pulls players into a world that’s as 
                haunting as it is profound.
            </div>
            <div class="column2">
                Another reason horror fans should turn to Project Moon’s titles is the company’s mastery in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0oSTZ5jtLQ" target="_blank">world-building</a>. 
                Both Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina feature intricate universes full of lore and hidden stories waiting to be uncovered. Every Abnormality, every character, and every 
                piece of dialogue holds a deeper meaning. The sense of mystery is palpable, as the more players explore these worlds, the more unsettling truths they uncover. This level of 
                depth is rarely seen in traditional horror games, which tend to prioritize immediate scares over a complex and evolving world. Instead of relying on sudden frights, Project Moon 
                crafts an atmosphere of unease and discovery. The horror unfolds gradually, making each revelation more impactful as players piece together the fragmented lore.
            </div>
            <div class="column3">
                Finally, the unique <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-art-of-games" target="_blank">art direction</a> in Project Moon’s games adds another layer of horror that 
                complements the gameplay and narrative. With its distinctive, often grotesque character designs, Project Moon’s visual style pulls players into its dark and twisted worlds. 
                The game’s anime-inspired art, combined with unsettling themes, creates a sense of dissonance—beauty mixed with horror—that amplifies the eerie atmosphere. This juxtaposition 
                between the gorgeous artwork and the disturbing content heightens the emotional impact, offering horror fans a visually captivating yet nightmarish experience.
